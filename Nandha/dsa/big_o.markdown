Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the upper bound of the time complexity or space complexity of an algorithm. It characterizes functions according to their growth rates: how the runtime or space requirements grow relative to the input size. Big O notation provides an upper limit on the growth rate, ensuring that, beyond a certain point, the algorithm will not exceed this limit.

### Common Big O Notations

1. **O(1) - Constant Time**:
   - The runtime is constant and does not change with the input size.
   - Example: Accessing an element in an array by index.

   ```python
   def constant_time_operation(arr, index):
       return arr[index]
   ```

2. **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time**:
   - The runtime grows logarithmically as the input size increases.
   - Example: Binary search in a sorted array.

   ```python
   def binary_search(arr, target):
       left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
       while left <= right:
           mid = (left + right) // 2
           if arr[mid] == target:
               return mid
           elif arr[mid] < target:
               left = mid + 1
           else:
               right = mid - 1
       return -1
   ```

3. **O(n) - Linear Time**:
   - The runtime grows linearly with the input size.
   - Example: Linear search in an array.

   ```python
   def linear_search(arr, target):
       for index in range(len(arr)):
           if arr[index] == target:
               return index
       return -1
   ```

4. **O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time**:
   - The runtime grows linearly multiplied by a logarithmic factor.
   - Example: Efficient sorting algorithms like mergesort or heapsort.

   ```python
   def merge_sort(arr):
       if len(arr) > 1:
           mid = len(arr) // 2
           left_half = arr[:mid]
           right_half = arr[mid:]

           merge_sort(left_half)
           merge_sort(right_half)

           i = j = k = 0

           while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
               if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                   arr[k] = left_half[i]
                   i += 1
               else:
                   arr[k] = right_half[j]
                   j += 1
               k += 1

           while i < len(left_half):
               arr[k] = left_half[i]
               i += 1
               k += 1

           while j < len(right_half):
               arr[k] = right_half[j]
               j += 1
               k += 1
   ```

5. **O(n^2) - Quadratic Time**:
   - The runtime grows quadratically with the input size.
   - Example: Simple sorting algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort.

   ```python
   def bubble_sort(arr):
       n = len(arr)
       for i in range(n):
           for j in range(0, n-i-1):
               if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                   arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
   ```

6. **O(2^n) - Exponential Time**:
   - The runtime grows exponentially with the input size.
   - Example: Solving the Tower of Hanoi problem.

   ```python
   def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
       if n == 1:
           print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
           return
       tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
       print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
       tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
   ```

7. **O(n!) - Factorial Time**:
   - The runtime grows factorially with the input size.
   - Example: Solving the traveling salesman problem using brute force.

### Understanding Big O Notation

- **Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case**:
  - **Best Case**: The performance of an algorithm under the most favorable conditions.
  - **Worst Case**: The performance of an algorithm under the least favorable conditions.
  - **Average Case**: The expected performance of an algorithm over all possible inputs.

- **Big O Notation** focuses on the worst-case scenario, providing an upper bound on the running time or space requirements.

- **Ignoring Constants and Lower Order Terms**:
  - Big O notation simplifies the expression by ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms since they become insignificant for large inputs.
  - For example, \( O(2n) \) simplifies to \( O(n) \), and \( O(n^2 + n) \) simplifies to \( O(n^2) \).

### Examples

1. **Constant Time - O(1)**:
   - Accessing an element in an array by index.
   
2. **Logarithmic Time - O(log n)**:
   - Binary search in a sorted array.

3. **Linear Time - O(n)**:
   - Finding the maximum element in an array.

4. **Linearithmic Time - O(n log n)**:
   - Efficient sorting algorithms like mergesort.

5. **Quadratic Time - O(n^2)**:
   - Simple sorting algorithms like bubble sort.

6. **Exponential Time - O(2^n)**:
   - Recursive algorithms that solve problems by breaking them into multiple smaller problems.

7. **Factorial Time - O(n!)**:
   - Brute-force solutions to combinatorial problems like the traveling salesman problem.

Big O notation helps compare the efficiency of different algorithms, allowing you to choose the most appropriate one for a given problem based on its expected performance and resource usage.
