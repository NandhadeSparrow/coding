1. **O(2^n) - Exponential Time**:
   - The runtime grows exponentially with the input size.
   - Example: Solving the Tower of Hanoi problem.

   ```python
   def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):
       if n == 1:
           print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
           return
       tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)
       print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
       tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)
   ```

2. **O(n!) - Factorial Time**:
   - The runtime grows factorially with the input size.
   - Example: Solving the traveling salesman problem using brute force.

### Understanding Big O Notation

- **Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case**:
  - **Best Case**: The performance of an algorithm under the most favorable conditions.
  - **Worst Case**: The performance of an algorithm under the least favorable conditions.
  - **Average Case**: The expected performance of an algorithm over all possible inputs.

- **Big O Notation** focuses on the worst-case scenario, providing an upper bound on the running time or space requirements.

- **Ignoring Constants and Lower Order Terms**:
  - Big O notation simplifies the expression by ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms since they become insignificant for large inputs.
  - For example, \( O(2n) \) simplifies to \( O(n) \), and \( O(n^2 + n) \) simplifies to \( O(n^2) \).

### Examples

1. **Constant Time - O(1)**:
   - Accessing an element in an array by index.
   
2. **Logarithmic Time - O(log n)**:
   - Binary search in a sorted array.

3. **Linear Time - O(n)**:
   - Finding the maximum element in an array.

4. **Linearithmic Time - O(n log n)**:
   - Efficient sorting algorithms like mergesort.

5. **Quadratic Time - O(n^2)**:
   - Simple sorting algorithms like bubble sort.

6. **Exponential Time - O(2^n)**:
   - Recursive algorithms that solve problems by breaking them into multiple smaller problems.

7. **Factorial Time - O(n!)**:
   - Brute-force solutions to combinatorial problems like the traveling salesman problem.

Big O notation helps compare the efficiency of different algorithms, allowing you to choose the most appropriate one for a given problem based on its expected performance and resource usage.
